## üì¶ Installation

### 1. File Structure

```
YourGame
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ServerScriptService
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SprintServer.lua
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ StarterPlayer
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ StarterPlayerScripts
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SprintClient.lua
```

### 2. Setup Instructions

1. **Create Server Script:**
   - In Roblox Studio, go to `ServerScriptService`
   - Insert a new `Script` (not LocalScript)
   - Name it `SprintServer`
   - Copy and paste the server code

2. **Create Client Script:**
   - Go to `StarterPlayer > StarterPlayerScripts`
   - Insert a new `LocalScript`
   - Name it `SprintClient`
   - Copy and paste the client code

3. **Test the Game:**
   - Press F5 to test in Studio
   - Click the sprint button on the right side of screen
   - Test with multiple players to see lightsticks replicate

## üéÆ How to Use

### For Players:
- **PC:** Click the sprint button or press it to toggle sprint mode
- **Mobile:** Tap the sprint button to toggle sprint mode
- **Status:** Watch the status label change from "WALK" to "RUNNING"

### Controls:
| Platform | Action |
|----------|--------|
| PC | Click sprint button (right side, mid-screen) |
| Mobile | Tap sprint button (right side, mid-screen) |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Speed Settings
Edit in both `SprintServer.lua` and `SprintClient.lua`:
```lua
local normalSpeed = 20  -- Default walk speed
local sprintSpeed = normalSpeed * 2  -- Sprint speed (40)
```

### Sound Assets
Edit in `SprintClient.lua`:
```lua
local SPRINT_START_SOUND_ID = "rbxassetid://YOUR_SOUND_ID"
local SPRINT_STOP_SOUND_ID = "rbxassetid://YOUR_SOUND_ID"
```

### Lightstick Appearance
Edit in `SprintServer.lua` (createServerLightSticks function):
```lua
lightStick.Size = Vector3.new(1.5, 0.2, 0.2)  -- Cylinder dimensions
lightStick.Material = Enum.Material.Neon  -- Material type
lightStick.Transparency = 0.1  -- Initial transparency
```

### Color Update Frequency
Edit in `SprintClient.lua`:
```lua
local COLOR_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 0.1  -- Update every 0.1 seconds
```

## üé® RGB Color Cycle

The lightsticks cycle through 12 colors:
1. Red
2. Orange
3. Yellow
4. Lime Green
5. Mint Green
6. Cyan
7. Sky Blue
8. Blue
9. Purple
10. Magenta
11. Pink
12. White

### Server-Client Communication

    A[Client: Click Button] --> B[RemoteEvent: ToggleSprint]
    B --> C[Server: Create/Remove Lightsticks]
    C --> D[Server: Change WalkSpeed]
    E[Client: Calculate RGB Color] --> F[RemoteEvent: UpdateColor]
    F --> G[Server: Update Lightstick Color]
    G --> H[All Players See Color Change]
```

### Remote Events

| Event Name | Direction | Purpose |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| `ToggleSprint` | Client ‚Üí Server | Toggle sprint state on/off |
| `UpdateColor` | Client ‚Üí Server | Update lightstick RGB color |

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Lightsticks not visible to other players
**Solution:** Make sure the server script is in `ServerScriptService`, not `StarterPlayerScripts`

### Issue: Sound not playing after respawn
**Solution:** The script automatically reloads sounds. Check if sound IDs are correct.

### Issue: Sprint button not appearing
**Solution:** Check if the client script is in `StarterPlayerScripts` as a LocalScript

### Issue: WalkSpeed not changing
**Solution:** Verify that both scripts have the same speed values configured

## üìä Performance Considerations

- Color updates are throttled to 10 updates/second per player
- Sounds are cached to prevent repeated asset loading
- Lightsticks are destroyed and recreated on respawn to prevent memory leaks
- Server validates all client requests for security
