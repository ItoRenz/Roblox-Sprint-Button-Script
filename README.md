- Dynamic UI with status labels

## Installation

1. Copy the main script to your game
2. Place it in `ServerScriptService` or `StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts`
3. The script automatically handles GUI creation and character management

## Controls

### PC
- Click the **‚ñ∂ Play Button** (top-right corner) to toggle sprint
- Button shows current status: "WALK" or "RUNNING"
- Visual feedback with color changes and animations
- Smooth rotation animation on button click

### Mobile
- Tap the **‚ñ∂ Play Button** (compact version, top-right corner)
- Same functionality as PC with optimized touch feedback
- Smooth scale animation on button tap

## Configuration

Edit these values in the script to customize behavior:

```lua
local normalSpeed = 16              -- Default walking speed
local sprintSpeed = normalSpeed * 2 -- Sprint speed (2x multiplier)
```

### Trail Customization

Modify trail properties in the `createHandLightSticks()` function:

```lua
trail.Lifetime = 0.5        -- Duration of light trail (increase for longer trails)
trail.MaxLength = 0         -- Max trail length (0 = unlimited)
```

### Color Cycling

The light stick cycles through 12 colors in sequence:
- Red ‚Üí Orange ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Lime Green ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Cyan ‚Üí Light Blue ‚Üí Dark Blue ‚Üí Purple ‚Üí Magenta ‚Üí Pink ‚Üí White

Adjust the speed by modifying this line:
```lua
local time = tick() * 3     -- Change 3 to increase/decrease cycle speed
```

### Light Stick Size

Customize the light stick dimensions:

```lua
lightStick.Size = Vector3.new(1.5, 0.2, 0.2)  -- Length, Height, Width
```

## File Structure

```
Sprint-System/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sprint-system.lua       # Main script
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # This file
```

## Technical Details

### Components

- **Light Stick**: Neon cylinder part welded to player's hand
- **Trail Effect**: Uses Roblox Trail object for visual feedback with smooth fade
- **Attachment Points**: Define trail start and end positions on the stick
- **Weld Constraint**: Keeps light stick attached to player's hand

### How It Works

1. When sprint is activated, two light sticks are created (one per hand)
2. Trail objects connect attachment points to create glowing trails
3. Colors cycle through rainbow spectrum at fixed intervals
4. Transparency pulses for dynamic effect
5. On respawn, old effects are cleaned up automatically
6. UI buttons toggle sprint state and update visual indicators

### Color Animation

The system uses a time-based sine wave for smooth pulsing:
```lua
local pulse = math.sin(time * 8) * 0.15 + 0.2
effect.stick.Transparency = pulse
```

## Performance Tips

- Trail lifetime is set to 0.5 seconds for optimal performance
- Adjust if experiencing frame drops on lower-end devices
- Reduced complexity by removing PointLight
- Efficient attachment-based trail system

## Requirements

- Roblox Studio or Roblox game environment
- Character model with RightHand and LeftHand parts
- Modern Roblox engine with Trail support

## Troubleshooting

**Light sticks not appearing?**
- Ensure character has RightHand and LeftHand parts
- Check script is running in correct service
- Verify part names exactly match (case-sensitive)

**Trail not showing?**
- Verify Attachment objects are created properly
- Check Trail Lifetime is greater than 0
- Ensure parts are not filtered or hidden

**Button not responding?**
- Verify UserInputService is accessible
- Check PlayerGui is available in player
- Ensure script has proper permissions

**Performance issues?**
- Reduce Trail.Lifetime value
- Lower color cycling speed (reduce tick() multiplier)
- Increase update frequency threshold

## Customization Examples

### Increase Trail Length
```lua
trail.Lifetime = 1.0  -- Double the trail duration
```

### Change Sprint Speed
```lua
local sprintSpeed = normalSpeed * 3  -- Triple speed sprint
```

### Modify Light Stick Color
```lua
lightStick.Color = Color3.fromRGB(255, 0, 0)  -- Set initial color
```

### Adjust Trail Transparency
```lua
trail.Transparency = NumberSequence.new({
    NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(0, 0),      -- Fully visible at start
    NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(0.5, 0.5),  -- Semi-transparent in middle
    NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(1, 1)       -- Fully transparent at end
})
```
